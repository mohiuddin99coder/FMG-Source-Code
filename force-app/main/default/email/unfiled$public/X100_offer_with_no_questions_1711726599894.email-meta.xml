Thank you for your recent inquiry about our Fire Mountain Gems and Beads&apos; Platinum Partners Wholesale program. We would love to earn your business.

As you saw, there is a minimum purchase of $3,000 in the previous 365 days in order to participate in Platinum Partner Annual Program. Since you are interested in purchasing with Fire Mountain Gems, I have set up your account to automatically apply the 100+ pricing discounts, no matter the size of your order! The additional savings will remain on your account through June 30th,XXXX. This opportunity should assist you in reaching the Platinum status, which will allow you to receive additional discounts.

In addition, we have a third-party company called Avalara, that manages our tax exemption certificates. Please let us know if you have a tax exemption so we can email you the paperwork.
