Getting to know our customers and their businesses is important to us as we feel with this information, we are able to alert you to new product that you may find useful in your designs and it makes your experience with us much more personal. It also gives us the opportunity to gain important feedback and possibly make changes based on that feedback. Please answer the questions below as thoroughly as possible and reply back, so I may complete your enrollment into the program. If you need any help, please give us a call. 

1. What type of business do you have? (Shows/Craft fairs, Storefront, Wholesaler, Non-profit/Charity, Online/Website)

2. How do you market your product or business? (Classes, Word Of Mouth, Shows/Fairs, Social Media, Online store, Consignment, Wholesale, etc.) 

3. What is the biggest challenge your business faces these days?

4. Do you feature your product or jewelry on your own websites? If so, we would love to see it, what is the web address?

5. Do you feature your product or jewelry on Social Media sites? We would love to know which sites you utilize and the web addresses to your shop or page.

6. Fire Mountain Gems strives to be your main resource for your jewelry and beading needs. Are you purchasing jewelry supplies from other vendors? If so, what type of product do you purchase, from whom, and why? (Better Pricing, Ease of Ordering, Fire Mountain doesn’t carry, etc.)

7. Do you hold a sales tax exemption certificate from your state? If so, I can send you a separate email to register with us.

Please be sure to log out, then back into your Fire Mountain Gems online account before building your next order, to ensure that your account information has been refreshed and your discount applied. You will see your Platinum Partner level discount applied to the price while you shop. This should make it easy for you to plan your expenses--something every business owner or designer-artist can relate to. 

Remember to log into your account before building an order, and please do not checkout as a guest, as the ordering system will not apply your discounts unless you’re logged in. Also, if you do need to call in an order, please use the exclusive Platinum phone line 888-364-4378. The Platinum team is here Monday-Friday 7am-5pm Pacific time.

Don’t hesitate to contact me, or if I’m not available, anyone on the Platinum team is able to help you if you have any questions. I look forward to working with you and I normally try to contact my customers periodically to check in as a courtesy.</textOnly>
