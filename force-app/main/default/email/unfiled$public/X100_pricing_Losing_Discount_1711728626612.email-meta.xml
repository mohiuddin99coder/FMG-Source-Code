    <textOnly>Dear Valued Customer,

Our Platinum Partners annual review is complete. Due to limited activity, your account no longer qualifies for automatic 100+ discount pricing. You will still receive all assortable discount pricing on your individual orders. 

If you have any questions, please call our friendly Customer Service representatives at 800-355-2137. 

Wishing you the very best,</textOnly>
