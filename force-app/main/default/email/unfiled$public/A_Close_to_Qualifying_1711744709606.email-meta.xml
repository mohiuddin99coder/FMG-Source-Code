    <textOnly>Dear XXXX,

This email is following the voicemail I just left for you, I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to let you know that you are very close to qualifying for our discount program that we have here at Fire Mountain Gems. This program is set up for our customers who are purchasing at higher volumes.

How do you become Platinum Partner?

You become a Platinum Partner by spending $3,000 in a 365-day period to be eligible for the 3 Star Platinum Program. Your current purchase total is $XXX which means you are only $XXX awayfrom qualifying. This amount will be accurate until XXX! If you were to order an average of $250.00 a month, this would qualify you for the program. Please note as our way of saying thank you for ordering with us, I have set up your account with the 100+ pricing discount. So, no matter the size of your order you will be getting the lowest advertised price until June 30th, XXXX!

In addition, we have a third-party company called Avalara, that manages our tax exemption certificates.  &lt;  &gt; Please let us know if you have a tax exemption so we can email you the paperwork.
